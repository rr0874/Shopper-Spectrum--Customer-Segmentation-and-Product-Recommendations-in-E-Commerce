# 🛒 Shopper Spectrum

**Shopper Spectrum** is an E-Commerce intelligence project that combines customer segmentation and personalized product recommendations using machine learning.

Built with **Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit**, this project helps online businesses:
- Predict customer segments (based on RFM analysis)
- Recommend similar products (based on item-based collaborative filtering)

---

## 📌 Features

### 🎯 1. Customer Segmentation
- Inputs: **Recency**, **Frequency**, **Monetary** values
- Outputs: Cluster label (e.g., High-Value, Regular, At-Risk)

### 🛍️ 2. Product Recommendation
- Input: Product name (e.g., "WHITE HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER")
- Output: 5 similar products based on cosine similarity

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Streamlit** – Web app framework
- **Scikit-learn** – KMeans Clustering, StandardScaler
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation
- **Joblib** – Model saving/loading
- **Collaborative Filtering** – For recommendation system
